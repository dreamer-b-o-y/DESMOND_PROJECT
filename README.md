WHAT IS DESMOND?
_______________

DESMOND project is not just a virtual assistant in your computer and it's not like [ google_assistane or Cortana or any V.assistante ]
DESMOND is a "Terminal commands executor" This means that any commands that you can write in your Terminal, can be executed without typing it you can just order DESMOND to execute it for you by just saying a verbal command or an oral order.

It's "Literally" just like JARVIS the AI of Tony Stark aka "Iron Man" or at least very close to it.

DESMOND consists of a set of pre-written instructions (commands) that can be executed  with just an oral order or a verbal command.
